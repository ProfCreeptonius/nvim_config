## Prof's neovim config
### UNIX version

Repository for my neovim config, based on:
  -  Kickstart: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim
  -  NvChad: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad

And some other plugins, see ./lua/custom/plugins/

This is *NOT PRODUCTION READY*: There are many evil hacks in this config!

If you insist on trying this config, clone this repo to your NeoVim config folder (usually ~/.config/nvim/), and run neovim *twice*. 
There will be errors the first time. This is a consequence of one of my hacks. Sorry.
