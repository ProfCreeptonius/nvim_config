## Prof's neovim config

Repository for my neovim config, based on:
  -  Kickstart: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim
  -  NvChad: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad

And some other plugins, see ./lua/custom/plugins/

This is *NOT PRODUCTION READY*: There are many evil hacks in this config!

This branch is specifically intended for use with Visual Studio Code and this extension: `https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim`. Thus it removes a lot of things specifically for NeoVim. Not intended for stand-alone use.
